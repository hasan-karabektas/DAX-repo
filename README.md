# DAX-repo

<u>SUMX calculated column in Dim Table</u>
The Dax formule is added to determine the "Current Cost" value, for every single row of the Dimension Table, to be calculated from other table(s). Depending on the conditional (IF) statement's outcome, being Yes/No, for every row, a sum aggregation of costs is operated and added based on the data located in the related Fact tables (Data2022, Data2021).
